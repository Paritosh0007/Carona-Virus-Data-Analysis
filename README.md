## About:-
#### What is Covid-19 – the illness that started in Wuhan?
* It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.
#### Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?
* In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:
  * stay indoors and avoid contact with other people as you would with the flu
  * call NHS 111 to inform them of your recent travel to the area
#### Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another?
* China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.
